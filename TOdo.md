# Learning resources to work through

### General Data Science stats

- Do [this](http://nbviewer.jupyter.org/github/nborwankar/LearnDataScience/tree/master/notebooks/) before the Machine Learning below.

- [Harvard CS09 course](http://cs109.github.io/2015/pages/videos.html). Lots of tutorials and lectures covering everything from pandas, web 
scraping to bayesian stats. 
  - perhaps start with the homeworks and labs which also have solutions [here](https://github.com/cs109/content)

#### Baysian Statistics

- Very important to get a decent grounding in this: [Programming and Bayesian Methods for 
hackers](http://nbviewer.jupyter.org/github/CamDavidsonPilon/Probabilistic-Programming-and-Bayesian-Methods-for-Hackers/blob/master/
Prologue/Prologue.ipynb)

- From the Harvard course:
  - [Bayesian Tomatoes](http://nbviewer.jupyter.org/github/cs109/content/blob/master/HW3.ipynb)
  - Lab 6: [Bayesianism, with MCMC] (http://nbviewer.jupyter.org/github/cs109/content/blob/master/labs/lab6/BayesLinear.ipynb)


### Machine Learning 

- Learn and understand [this introduction](http://www.astroml.org/sklearn_tutorial/general_concepts.html) from the python lib scikit. I also 
like this [reference map](http://scikit-learn.org/stable/tutorial/machine_learning_map/index.html). 

- Clone [this](https://github.com/ogrisel/sklearn_pycon2014) repository and work through.

- Do the MonkeyLearn tutorials [here]

Newsletter& utm_campaign=actionable-insights-reviews-using-machine-learning-part1)
and[here]
 (https://blog.monkeylearn.com/hacker-news-categorizer-with-monkeylearn/?utm_source=Email&utm_medium=Intercom&utm_content=FP&
utm_campaign=16-hacker-news-categorizer)

- [Very quick and dirty introduction to Random Forests](http://blog.yhat.com/posts/random-forests-in-python.html) using python and iris 
data.

- From harvard data science course Lab 4: [Scikit-Learn, Regression, and 
PCA](http://nbviewer.jupyter.org/github/cs109/content/blob/master/labs/lab4/Lab4full.ipynb)

### SQL

- Complete [this](http://sol.gfxile.net/g3/) excellent tutorial playing around with astronomy data. Done! 

- Do [this](http://www.sqlcourse.com/) basic tutorial, followed by [this](http://www.sqlcourse2.com/) more advanced one. Looks good with 
lots of questions (+ answers!).

- With a good grounding in SQL, the next step is PL/SQL. Exercism.io might be a good place to pick this up.

- Dip into [this](http://dev.mysql.com/doc/refman/5.5/en/examples.html) tutorial which goes through common queries from MySQL.

- Find a MySQL project to work on.

### Pandas and Python

- Start working through [exorcism.io](http://exercism.io/languages/python#exercises)

- [How to think like a computer scientist](http://interactivepython.org/runestone/static/thinkcspy/toc.html) with clear explanations, 
videos and tests you as you go through.

- Work through [these Python 3 tutorial videos](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PL1A2CSdiySGJd0LJRRSwQZbPZaDP0q67j). They are nice 
and short.

- [Matplotlib visualisation tutorial](https://www.dataquest.io/blog/matplotlib-tutorial/) which encorporates sentiment analysis with 
suggested futher exercises.

### Kaggle

- Do the Titanic competition.
  - Start with this for [Python](https://www.kaggle.com/c/titanic/details/getting-started-with-python) and [then 
again](https://www.kaggle.com/c/titanic/details/getting-started-with-python-ii), but using pandas.
  There is also [this introduction](https://www.dataquest.io/mission/74/getting-started-with-kaggle/) from DataQuest which looks quite 
interesting and might be a good first step into python 3.
