# Learning resources to work through

### General Data Science stats

- Do [this](http://nbviewer.jupyter.org/github/nborwankar/LearnDataScience/tree/master/notebooks/) before the Machine Learning below.


### Machine Learning 

- Learn and understand [this introduction](http://www.astroml.org/sklearn_tutorial/general_concepts.html) from the python lib scikit. I also 
like this [reference map](http://scikit-learn.org/stable/tutorial/machine_learning_map/index.html). 

- Clone [this](https://github.com/ogrisel/sklearn_pycon2014) repository and work through.

- Do the MonkeyLearn tutorials [here]

### SQL

- Complete [this](http://sol.gfxile.net/g3/) excellent tutorial playing around with astronomy data. 

- Dip into [this](http://dev.mysql.com/doc/refman/5.5/en/examples.html) tutorial which goes through common queries from MySQL.

- Find a MySQL project to work on.

### Pandas

- Work through as many of the examples as possible in a ipython notebook, making lots of notes.  

### Kaggle

- Do the Titanic competition.
  - Start with this for [Python](https://www.kaggle.com/c/titanic/details/getting-started-with-python) and [then 
again](https://www.kaggle.com/c/titanic/details/getting-started-with-python-ii), but using pandas.
  There is also [this introduction](https://www.dataquest.io/mission/74/getting-started-with-kaggle/) from DataQuest which looks quite 
interesting and might be a good first step into python 3.
