# Data Science Daily Discoveries

This is a daily diary to keep me focussed and moving. 
Every day I will upload something I have learned on the path to gaining data 
science skills.

I'm using the [IPython Notebook](http://ipython.org) the Anaconda (2.4.1) 
Python (2.7.11) distribution.


### Links to each day:

Day 1: I learned some [git commands](001-git-basics.md) and [played around 
with some data](001-pandas-csv/LendingClub.ipynb) in ipython using the pandas 
library.

Day 2: More pandas practise. Re-discovered the usefulness of cheatsheats. Now 
have a number of functions for exploring the data.
