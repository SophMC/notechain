# Project Learn Python

Every day I will upload a new notebook of something new I have done.

I'm using the [IPython Notebook](http://ipython.org).


### Links to each day:

Day 1: I learned some [git commands](001-git-basics.md) and played around with 
some data in ipython using the pandas library.
